Code signing ensures that users can trust your application and prevents
security warnings during installation.

üìã REQUIREMENTS BY PLATFORM:

üçé macOS Code Signing:
   Prerequisites:
   - Apple Developer Account ($99/year)
   - Developer ID Application Certificate
   - Access to macOS machine for signing

   Setup Steps:
   1. Enroll in Apple Developer Program
   2. Generate Developer ID Application Certificate
   3. Download certificate to keychain
   4. Set APPLE_CERTIFICATE_IDENTITY environment variable
   5. Optionally notarize for Gatekeeper compatibility

   Environment Variables:
   export APPLE_CERTIFICATE_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name"
   export APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Your Name"
   export APPLE_ID="your@email.com"
   export APPLE_PASSWORD="app-specific-password"
   export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAM12345"

ü™ü Windows Code Signing:
   Prerequisites:
   - Code signing certificate (from CA like DigiCert, Sectigo)
   - Windows machine or cross-platform signing tool

   Setup Steps:
   1. Purchase code signing certificate
   2. Install certificate or use Azure Key Vault
   3. Set certificate thumbprint in tauri.conf.json
   4. Configure timestamp server

   Environment Variables:
   export WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_THUMBPRINT="abcdef1234567890..."
   export WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD="certificate-password"

üêß Linux Code Signing:
   - Linux AppImages don't require code signing
   - GPG signing can be used for additional verification
   - Distribution through repositories provides trust

echo "2. For Windows signing:"
echo "   - Get code signing certificate"
echo "   - Update tauri.conf.json certificateThumbprint"
echo ""
echo "3. Test signing:"
echo "   npm run build"
echo ""
echo "4. For CI/CD, store certificates securely:"
echo "   - Use GitHub Secrets for certificate data"
echo "   - Use environment variables for passwords"
